Things To Do
------------
+ This was inteded as a learning excercise. It does not provide validation at all.
+ <i>Settings</i> menu can add any kind of settings functionality. I was thinking of just changing the theme color.
+ I have hardcoded the search_box top margin value. This should be adaptable.
+ Project overall should adapt to a mobile with any API_LEVEL, any orientation, any screen_size.
